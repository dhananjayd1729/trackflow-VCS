# Trackflow

Trackflow is a simple version control system inspired by Git. It allows you to track changes to your files, create commits with messages, and view the history of changes.

## Features

- **Initialization**: Set up a new Trackflow repository.
- **Adding Files**: Add files to the staging area.
- **Committing**: Create a new commit with a message.
- **Log**: View the history of commits.
- **Show Diff**: Show the differences between a commit and its parent.

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, create a new directory for your project and place the `trackflow.js` script inside it.

```sh
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
# Save the trackflow.js script here basically do 
./trackflow.mjs init 
#now you can use add, commit, show diff and log commands.
```
